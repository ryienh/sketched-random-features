# Sketch-Augmented Features Improve Learning Long-Range Dependencies in Graph Neural Networks

This repository contains the source code for our manuscript [Sketch-Augmented Features Improve Learning Long-Range Dependencies in Graph Neural Networks](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/poster/116734). Our _Sketched Random Features_ enhance graph neural networks by incorporating randomized global embeddings of node features alongside traditional local representations. Such a strategy mitigates common weaknesses of GNNs such as oversquashing in the presence of informative node features.

### Getting started

To install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

>ðŸ“‹  Note: Pytorch geometric (and some of its dependencies) may require a separate system specific installation process. If Pytorch Geometric cannot be installed directly with pip, please refer to the [Pytorch Geometric Installation Guide](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html) to install this package.

## Quick Start
SRF integrates into existing machine learning pipelines with message-passing graph neural networks in two steps. Note that our implementation is in [Pytorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

First, generate SRF features during preprocessing using the `AddFeaturesTransform` class in `srf/preprocess.py`. This class can be passed as a preprocessing function to Pytorch Geometric style datasets. For example, with a [Open Graph Benchmark dataset](https://ogb.stanford.edu/):

```
from ogb.graphproppred import PygGraphPropPredDataset
transform_args = {"width": 128, "K": 256}
transform = AddFeaturesTransform(
        D_out=transform_args["width"],
        k=transform_args["K"],
        )
dataset = PygGraphPropPredDataset(
        name=dataset_name.lower(), pre_transform=transform
)
```

Second, these features should be injected into each layer of the message-passing graph neural network during training. The file `srf/main.py` contains simple examples of this injection process (as described in Section 3 of our main manuscript). Different configurations and datasets can be customized in the `config` dictionary in the main function of this file.  

## Manuscript Experiments

The following section includes instructions on reproducing the experiments in our manuscript.  

### Experiments on Synthetic Data

To run expressiveness (CSL) experiments, execute `main.py` with default settings:

```
cd srf
python main.py
```

To run [[Tree-NeighborsMatch](https://github.com/tech-srl/bottleneck)] (oversquashing) dataset, refer to its respective `README.md`:

```
cd srf/bottleneck_gnn
cat README.md
```

To run oversmoothing analysis and generate associated figures (Figure 1 in the manuscript):

```
cd srf
python oversmoothing.py
```


### Experiments on Real-World Data
Instructions to run experiments on real world graph learning tasks (Section 4.2) are contained in the `README.md` files of the appropriate subdirectories. For experiments on the Reddit datasets:

```
cd experiments/reddit-pe
cat README.md
```

For the DrugOOD and Peptides experiments:

```
cd experiments/molecules-pe
cat README.md
```
