## Testing Oversquashing on Tree-NeighborsMatch

To run experiments with SRF:

```
python run-srf-2-8.py
```

Sketch variant can be customized in the file above by substituting the relevant enum:

```
gnn_type = GNN_TYPE.GINLaplace
gnn_type = GNN_TYPE.GINRBF
gnn_type = GNN_TYPE.GINLinear
gnn_type = GNN_TYPE.GINLaplaceNoSketch
```

This experiment uses the framework provided by [[Tree-NeighborsMatch repo](https://github.com/tech-srl/bottleneck)] by Alon and Yahav, 2021. Their original README is below for reference.


## On the Bottleneck of Graph Neural Networks and its Practical Implications

This is the official implementation of the paper: [On the Bottleneck of Graph Neural Networks and its Practical Implications](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=i80OPhOCVH2) (ICLR'2021),
which introduces the **over-squashing** problem of GNNs.

this repository is divided into three sub-projects:

1. The subdirectory `tf-gnn-samples` is a clone of 
[https://github.com/microsoft/tf-gnn-samples](https://github.com/microsoft/tf-gnn-samples) by Brockschmidt (ICML'2020). 
This project can be used to reproduce the QM9 and VarMisuse experiments of Section 4.2 and 4.2 in the paper.
This sub-project depends on TensorFlow 1.13.
The instructions for our clone are the same as their original code, except that reproducing our experiments 
(the QM9 dataset and VarMisuse) can be done by running the
script `tf-gnn-samples/run_qm9_benchs_fa.py` or `tf-gnn-samples/run_varmisuse_benchs_fa.py` instead of their original scripts.
For additional dependencies and instructions, see their original README: 
[https://github.com/microsoft/tf-gnn-samples/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/microsoft/tf-gnn-samples/blob/master/README.md).
The main modification that we performed is using a Fully-Adjacent layer as the last 
GNN layer and we describe in our paper. 
2. The subdirectory `gnn-comparison` is a clone of [https://github.com/diningphil/gnn-comparison](https://github.com/diningphil/gnn-comparison)
by Errica et al. (ICLR'2020). 
This project can be used to reproduce the biological experiments (Section 4.3, the ENZYMES and NCI1 datasets).
This sub-project depends on PyTorch 1.4 and Pytorch-Geometric.
For additional dependencies and instructions, see their original README: 
[https://github.com/diningphil/gnn-comparison/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/diningphil/gnn-comparison/blob/master/README.md).
The instructions for our clone are the same, except that we added an additional flag to every `config_*.yml` file, called `last_layer_fa`, 
which is set to `True` by default, and reproduces our experiments.
The main modification that we performed is using a Fully-Adjacent layer as the last 
GNN layer.
3. The main directory (in which this file resides) can be used to reproduce the experiments of 
Section 4.1 in the paper, for the "Tree-NeighborsMatch" problem. The rest of this README file includes the 
instructions for this main directory. 
This repository can be used to reproduce the experiments of 

This project was designed to be useful in experimenting with new GNN architectures and new solutions for the over-squashing problem.

## Requirements

### Dependencies
This project is based on PyTorch 1.4.0 and the [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/) library.
* First, install PyTorch from the official website: [https://pytorch.org/](https://pytorch.org/).
* Then install PyTorch Geometric: [https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html)
* Eventually, run the following to verify that all dependencies are satisfied:
```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file lists the additional requirements.
 However, PyTorch Geometric might requires manual installation, and we thus recommend to use the 
`requirements.txt` file only afterward.


Verify that importing the dependencies goes without errors:
```
python -c 'import torch; import torch_geometric'
```



### Hardware
Training on large trees (depth=8) might require ~60GB of RAM and about 10GB of GPU memory.
GPU memory can be compromised by using a smaller batch size and using the `--accum_grad` flag.

For example, instead of running:
```
python main.py --batch_size 1024 --type GGNN
```

The following uses gradient accumulation, and takes less GPU memory:
```
python main.py --batch_size 512 --accum_grad 2 --type GGNN
```

## Reproducing Experiments

To run a single experiment from the paper, run:

```
python main.py --help
```
And see the available flags.
For example, to train a GGNN with depth=4, run:
```
python main.py --task DICTIONARY --eval_every 1000 --depth 4 --num_layers 5 --batch_size 1024 --type GGNN
```  

To train a GNN across all depths, run one of the following:
```
python run-gcn-2-8.py
python run-gat-2-8.py
python run-ggnn-2-8.py
python run-gin-2-8.py
```

## Results

The results of running the above scripts are (Section 4.1 in the paper):

r:   | 2   	| 3   	| 4    	| 5    	| 6    	| 7    	| 8    	|
------	|-----	|-----	|------	|------	|------	|------	|------	|
 **GGNN** 	| 1.0 	| 1.0 	| 1.0  	| 0.60 	| 0.38 	| 0.21 	| 0.16 	|
 **GAT**  	| 1.0 	| 1.0 	| 1.0  	| 0.41 	| 0.21 	| 0.15 	| 0.11 	|
 **GIN**  	| 1.0 	| 1.0 	| 0.77 	| 0.29 	| 0.20 	|      	|      	|
 **GCN**  	| 1.0 	| 1.0 	| 0.70 	| 0.19 	| 0.14 	| 0.09 	| 0.08 	|

## Experiment with other GNN types
To experiment with other GNN types:
* Add the new GNN type to the `GNN_TYPE` enum [here](common.py#L34), for example: `MY_NEW_TYPE = auto()`
* Add another `elif self is GNN_TYPE.MY_NEW_TYPE:` to instantiate the new GNN type object [here](common.py#L47)
* Use the new type as a flag for the `main.py` file:
```
python main.py --type MY_NEW_TYPE ...
```
